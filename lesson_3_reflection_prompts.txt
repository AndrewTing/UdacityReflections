When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- If you have a team of developers working on a project.
- If you are trying to share files with other people or organizations.
- A way of backing up your files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- You might not want someone else's changes yet
- The automatic changes might interfere with your existing changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are usually complete 'clones' of other repositories on github.  
- clones are a copy of a repository, and could be a clone of a remote or a local repository.
- branches only exist in a repository.
